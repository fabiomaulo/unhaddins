- Each node must expose the way to be created outside a parsing process.
For example an IntegerLiteral must expose a property/method to assign an int/long value
and the implementation must assign the same values availables during the string-parse process.
The same for ValueClause (it must expose something to assign values).
This feature give us the opportunity to create an HQL-AST from multiple source including criteria-API or
any other OO query system ( ;) ).
